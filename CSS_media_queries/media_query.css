/* 
* CHALLENGE 1:
    - If the user is viewing the page in a landscape mode on their phone (galaxy S8+), increase the font size of the nav bar and footer.
    - Include a bit of spacing within the footer so that the text isn't directly on the bottom of the screen.

* CHALLENGE 2:
    - Create a media query to accept a screen AND the width of a iPhone SE (375px).
    - Have the navigational options not display.
    - Enlarge the Brand Text so that it is more of a focal point in the header. Make it larger
